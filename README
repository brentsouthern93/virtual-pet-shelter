VIRTUAL PET SHELTER:

-This is similar to the Virtual Pet Project except you are now in charge of 5 pets
-You can feed them/Water them/play with them
-You can donate a pet to the shelter and you can adopt a pet from the shelter!
-The simulation runs in a loop with switch statements, while the game is (not quit)

HAVE FUN!
